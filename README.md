![home-assitant_a2a580f0fe7a1354a109eb062b5393fbb330f508-urls](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d91a5adc-93e0-490b-a8c1-9d3c63824e82)  

## 🔆 Overview
BDiff is a text-based differencing algorithm that can identify accurate line-level and block-level differences between text files and generate corresponding edit scripts. It can be applied in scenarios such as code review and change analysis.

## I. 🎻 Main Features
- **Language-independent**: BDiff is a text-based differencing algorithm and can thus be applied to code written in any programming language.
- **Comprehensive Difference Identification**: It can identify line deletions, line additions, line updates, line splits, line merges, block copies (including line updates), and block moves (including line updates).
- **Generate Edit Scripts**: Produces edit scripts based on the identified differences.
- **Display Updated Difference Substrings**: Shows the specific substrings that have been updated.
- **Edit Action Localization**: Helps pinpoint the edit actions within the script.
- **View Before-and-After Mapped Lines/Blocks**: Allows users to view the mapped lines or blocks before and after the changes.
- **Set Difference Display Modes**: Offers alignment mode and compact mode for displaying differences.
- **Language Settings**: Supports Chinese and English.
- **Theme Settings**: Switch between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.
- **Difference Option Settings**: Customize comparison parameters for precise results.
- **Programming Language Highlighting**: Syntax-aware highlighting for major programming languages.
## 2. 📜 Usage Instructions
### 2.1 Quick Start
1. Visit the BDiff online tool at http://bdiff.net/.
2. Upload the old and new versions of your text file via the file selector.
3. Click to view the difference results.
### 2.2 Option Settings
- **Git Difference Algorithm**: Choose from Git's four differencing algorithms. Results may vary slightly; the default Histogram algorithm typically produces the shortest edit scripts.
- **Tab Length**: Number of spaces a tab character represents, affecting alignment calculations.
- **Minimum Length of Moved Block**: The minimum number of lines a moved block should contain.
- **Minimum Length of Copied Block**: The minimum number of lines a copied block should contain.
- **Context Length**: The number of lines above or below a line/block when calculating context similarity.
- **Line Similarity Weight**: The proportion of line similarity in the overall line mapping similarity calculation, which also takes into account context similarity.
- **Overall Line Similarity Threshold**: If the overall line mapping similarity is greater than or equal to this threshold, it is considered a valid line mapping.
- **Maximum Merged Lines**: The maximum number of lines allowed when detecting line merges.
- **Maximum Split Lines**: The maximum number of lines allowed when detecting line splits.
- **Identify Block Moves**: Enable/disable detection of block moves.
- **Identify Block Copies**: Enable/disable detection of block copies.
- **Include Updates in Moves**: Detect line updates within moved blocks.
- **Include Updates in Copies**: Detect line updates within copied blocks.
- **Include Lines with Only Stop Words in Moved Block Size Calculation**: Whether to count lines containing only stop words when calculating the size of moved blocks.
- **Include Lines with Only Stop Words in Copied Block Size Calculation**: Whether to count lines containing only stop words when calculating the size of copied blocks.
